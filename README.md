# Instacart Basket Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Data Analytics learning journey. It involves an analysis of Instacart's online grocery shopping data to uncover sales patterns and customer behaviors. The goal is to derive insights for better customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.

**Note:** This project uses a fictional version of Instacart and simulated data for educational purposes.

## Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis on Instacart's data to inform targeted marketing strategies and answer key business questions.

## Key Questions
- What are the busiest days and hours for orders?
- When do customers spend the most money?
- How can products be grouped into price range categories?
- Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
- How do customer ordering behaviors differ based on loyalty status, region, age, and family status?

- Customer Data (fictional, created for this project)
- Instacart Data Sets (from "The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017")
